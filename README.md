# voxeljs-next
The next generation of Voxel JS.

This project updates the original [voxeljs](https://voxeljs.com/) with modern Javascript (classes, ES6 modules, arrow 
functions, etc), and brings it in line with the latest [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), with support for the latest
WebGL features, and also adds VR/AR support.  

Because of these improvements, *voxeljs-next is not compatible with the original VoxelJS modules*. All old modules and 
features will need to be ported to the new code. 



# TBD

* explain how meshing and chunking works. the core algorithm
* explain how rendering works. esp texture mapping.
